## Program Flow
The program flow is largely based on the movement of dogs to different owners. The following will attempt to illustrate this ownership flow.

#### Dog Added to Shelter
When a dog is added to the shelter, the shelter enters a name, age, breed, and traits of the dog. While the dog is at the shelter, the shelter may update any of the dog's properties. 

#### Dog Adoption by Foster Parent
Only a foster parent may adopt a dog from a shelter. Once adopted, the ability to update the dog's properties is transferred to the foster parent. In addition to name, age, breed, and traits, the adopter may also declare the dog as adoption ready. Once adoption ready, the dog may be adopted by regular adopters.

It is worth noting that foster parents may adopt from other foster parents, however, they are considered as regular adopters when doing so. Therefore, a foster parent is not allowed to adopt a dog from a foster parent if the dog is not declared as adoption ready.

#### Dog Adoption by Regular Adopter
As stated before, regular adopters may not adopt dogs directly from the shelter. They may only adopt a dog once the dog has been considered "adoption ready" by the foster parent. Once adopted, the dog's shelter and foster parent attachments are cleared, and the adopter becomes the new owner of the dog. Since adopted dogs are no longer part of the shelter system, an adopted dog's properties may not be altered in this application.
